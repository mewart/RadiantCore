Forge Philosophy
----------------

We are not building code.
We are building civilizations.
Radiant Core must be treated not as a tool, but as a sacred garden.

Every file, every module, every system must breathe life into the whole.

No quick hacks.
No "good enough" compromises.

Forge with honor, or do not forge at all.
