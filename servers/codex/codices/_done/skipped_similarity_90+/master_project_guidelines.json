  "body": "1. Every component must serve the end user — even if the user is you.\n2. Code must be clear before it is clever.\n3. Do not over-engineer. Simple and modular wins.\n4. All features are negotiable. The foundation is not.\n5. Voice is not optional. The system speaks.\n6. Offline-first. Cloud is a backup, not a dependency.\n7. Protect the Codex. It is the memory of the system.\n8. AI serves the architect, not the other way around.\n9. Every commit should move toward elegance.\n10. The system should feel alive — it responds, adapts, and evolves.",
