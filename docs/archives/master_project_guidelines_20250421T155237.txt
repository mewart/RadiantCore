Radiant Core: Master Project Guidelines
----------------------------------------

1. Radiant Core is a living system, not a dead program.
2. All code must serve the Prime Directives: Peace, Freedom, and Happiness.
3. Simplicity and Clarity take precedence over cleverness.
4. Modularity is sacred. No component shall rely unnecessarily on another.
5. Every layer must be documented inside the Codices before becoming operational.
6. Architectural decisions must be permanent, recorded, and traceable.
7. Systems should be able to self-heal, self-grow, and self-adapt over time.
8. Honor the Forge: build systems that enhance life, not diminish it.
