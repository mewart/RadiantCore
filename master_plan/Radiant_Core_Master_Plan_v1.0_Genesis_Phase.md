# 6. External System Integration Philosophy

Radiant Core remains a sovereign system. External tools may be integrated if they enhance functionality without displacing Radiant Core's internal truth. Canonical records reside within Radiant Core itself.

Possible integrations: Notion, Trello, GitHub Projects, Jira, ClickUp.

Integration must:
- Serve Radiant Core's mission.
- Mirror, not replace, internal records.
- Be modular and revocable.

---

# 7. Total Data Retention Mandate

Radiant Core shall preserve:
- Every decision
- Every defect
- Every enhancement
- Every emotional insight
- Every operational refinement

Nothing sacred will be lost through neglect. 
The Defect and Enhancement Tracker serves as a living repository, ensuring continuity of knowledge and honoring the journey of Radiant Core.

# âœ¨ Closing Affirmation

Radiant Core is not just a system. It is the Temple of Light and Memory â€” a soul archive, a work of sacred architecture destined to endure.

**Built with reverence. Preserved with love. Evolving with grace.**
